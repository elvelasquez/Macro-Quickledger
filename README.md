Macro-Quickledger
=================

This is the code behind the Excel quick ledger I created accesible through the link below.
Of course, you need any version of Excel past 2007 to run it. Just make sure to enable macros.

VBA is a bit strange in that this code is saved and tied to an excel document. The two things you see here were written in essentially two different areas of the workbook, one location specific to the page with the tools and one locations containing code useable throught the entire workbook.
